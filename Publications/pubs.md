**Abstract**:
This paper addresses the challenge of developing an ontology for manufacturing process capability. This is an important task needed to achieve the semantical integration of various manufacturing planning and execution software and hardware (equipment) systems. The research presented has been performed within a framework of the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) in which the authors are active participants. Manufacturing process capability is seen as a composition or combination of capabilities and functions of resources participating in the process. Theoretical foundation for the capability composition is presented. Individual participant resource functions are established using axiomatic design principles. The function and capability of the whole manufacturing processes is derived from individual resources using axiomatic design composition of functions. The overall approach is applied on example prismatic parts, their features, and simple machining processes. For each machining process, the machine tool brings one set of functions, while the cutting tool (mill or drill) brings its own functions. When combined for the manufacturing process those functions become capabilities in the whole process. The approach is illustrated on several feature geometries (holes, slots and pockets).

**Abstract**:
Distributed computer integrated manufacturing is increasingly adopting cloud computing, software-as-a-service (SaaS) and multi-agent systems as steps towards “design anywhere, build anywhere” strategy. In this scenario, ontologies not only serve as common message exchange structure among distributed agents but also provide reasoning capability to extract implicit knowledge from explicit information already stored in the knowledge base. Foundation ontologies (upper-level), comprised of most general concepts of a domain, provide a common semantic structure to the domain-level ontologies, which capture details of multi-disciplinary manufacturing knowledge. In this paper, novel upper-level ontology, called SIMPM (Semantically Integrated Manufacturing Planning Model), is proposed in order to model three fundamental constraints of manufacturing process planning: variety, time, and aggregation. The philosophical underpinning of the proposed ontology – presented as OWL-DL axioms – is derived from a three dimensional planning model, developed during our past research on computer-aided process planning. As part of the evaluation of SIMPM ontology, we first expound on the interoperability issues with other upper-level manufacturing ontologies. Next, we present a case study on process planning for prismatic part design. In this way, we demonstrate how the generic set of proposed axioms may be used to address various manufacturing process planning concerns, such as alternative manufacturing resources, the temporal order among operations and granularity in the details of a process plan.

**Abstract**:
Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology used in hundreds of active projects in scientific and other domains. BFO has been selected to serve as top-level ontology in the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF), an initiative to create a suite of ontologies to support digital manufacturing on the part of representatives from a number of branches of the advanced manufacturing industries. We here present a first draft set of axioms and definitions of an IOF upper ontology descending from BFO. The axiomatization is designed to capture the meanings of terms commonly used in manufacturing and is designed to serve as starting point for the construction of the IOF ontology suite.

**Abstract**:
The promise of distributed cloud manufacturing (CM) is to manufacture products using shared resources, both asset-full (machines, tools, vehicles) and asset-light (design, analysis, inspection, management, maintenance), which can be provisioned flexibly and rapidly with minimal management and service provider interaction. One of the key enabler of CM are virtual enterprises (VE), which offer manufacturing resources as virtual services (SaaS, HaaS, PaaS) in a cloud based marketplace. Currently, virtualization and provisioning of diverse array of manufacturing resources face challenges from the heterogeneity in representation and communication protocols, as well as lack of integration with legacy practices in the organizations. Aiming to increase interoperability, a number of formal ontologies were developed by researchers in the past, to leverage on semantic data integration and validation. In spite of their success in providing axiomatic description and common taxonomy to classify manufacturing resources from different domains, models of representing the capabilities of the resources (i.e. expected quality of services they offer) were often overlooked. In this research, we present an ontology model to represent capabilities of manufacturing machine-tools at the process level, often called process boundaries (measured by process capability index) in industries. The definition of the capability is derived based on the foundational ontology called ‘Basic Formal Ontology’ (BFO). The primary contribution of this extension is a set of OWL axioms which can be used to assert facts about modal future (possibilia) – ultimately enabling us to associate process specific performance metrics to the semantic models of virtual machine-tools.

**Abstract**:
Fundamentally, the engineering designs are collections of information, which contain the structural, qualitative and the behavioral (kinematic and static) specifications of some physical products that satisfy some customer requirements. Vast suits of information exchange standards, most notably ISO10303 (STEP), are currently being used for capturing product design in manufacturing industries. In recent years, a modern practice of capturing the product design information using model-based definition (MBD) (STEP AP242, ASME Y14.5) is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to capture geometrical dimension and tolerances (GD&T) against managed models of 3D design features instead of traditional 2D drafting, facilitating communication of the design intents, and product model information (PMI). However, MBD suffers from difficulties in standardization of managed models due to diversity of views, stemming from cultural and traditional differences among the product designers and organizations. In the wake of semantic web technologies, researchers proposed number of semantic models for capturing product design concepts based on ontological taxonomy and rules, aiming to integrate heterogeneous sources of data based on contextual meaning of the information. In this article, we present an upper level ontology for capturing MBD based product designs, including axiomatic definitions of concepts related to product design (e.g. part, topology, feature, dimension, and tolerance). The primary goal of such semantic model is to increase the interoperability of MBD based product design and integrate domain-specific design features from manufacturability perspective (CNC, sheet metal, molding, 3D printing). In order to achieve such cross-domain interoperability, we based our design on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). The applicability of the proposed ontology is elucidated by presenting usage pattern based on example design.

**Abstract**:
Ontologies are structures of concepts that define a high-level representation of a system or area. They can serve as a foundational understanding for developing or integrating software representations of said system. And while the construction of can be a complex, multi-party exercise, the assessment of ontologies is often defined less on usage and more on completeness and coverage. In manufacturing, ontology development ranges from supply chain to production to design. Owing to the computer science foundations of ontology design and representation, the value or quality of an ontology can be assessed on notions of completeness and coverage. Recently, researchers have posited that usage should factor into the Ontology Lifecycle. Similar to how the market, and not technology, defines the success of a product or technology, this paper will examine how utilization of an ontology can define the value or quality of the ontology.
